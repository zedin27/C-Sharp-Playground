These are personal notes and locally tested. You may encounter issues compiling due the dependencies needed and machine being used.

## Notes

Introductory C# work and projects done

This shows the learning experience from C# before jumping into Unity.

My goals after understanding C# is to go through Unity. For each of the list, it will contain some notes in regards of the following:

- [x] Mammoth and game Loop text game(Course for C# would take roughly 15-20hrs)
- [x] Linear Algebra (introduction to game development and general understanding ~30hrs-40hrs)
- [ ] Unity Course (~36hrs)
- [ ] Flappy Bird (~20hrs?)
- [ ] Tetris (~20hrs?)
- [ ] Rubik's Cube (~30hrs with Unity?)

## Mammoth (Course for C#)

If I want to test C#, check out "rextester.com" ? Nah.
Entry points varies through OS to OS.
Use this guide as a base, but not too seriously...

## Resources

Some Resources can be found in each project folder worked on too.

## TODO

- [ ] Focus in game physics with Unity
- [x] Create a vector math, transformation classes
- [ ] Practice virtual, abstract, and override methods
- [ ] Restructure directories

Holy shit, no code because I got trolled!
