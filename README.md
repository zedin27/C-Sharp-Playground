## Notes

Introductory C# work and projects done

This shows the learning experience from C# before jumping into Unity.

My goals after understanding C# is to go through Unity. For each of the list, it will contain some notes in regards of the following:

- [ ] Mammoth and game Loop text game(Course for C# would take roughly 15-20hrs)
- [ ] Flappy Bird (10hrs-20hrs)
- [ ] Tetris (10hrs-20hrs)
- [ ] Rubik's Cube (30hrs with Unity and learning linear algebra and matrices)

## Mammoth (Course for C#)

If I want to test C#, check out "rextester.com" ? Nah.
Entry points varies through OS to OS.

## TODO:

- [ ] Restructure directories
- [ ] Having one solution for the repo to work all together (and avoid obj/bin folders)
- [ ] Practice virtual, abstract, and override methods
- [ ]
